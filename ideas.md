# Here will be ideas or something

1. Subway surfers with numbers to choose and obstacle that take score and the
   player should choose greatest numbers from hexadecimal, binary and
   characters ASCII.
2. (greedy) Make a UI to move images and build and von neumman model from
   computer, kinda boring because how do we win?
3. Pipe mania, with instructions and time efficiency to give feedback, map of
   instructions, using the book to give idea, rotate it will be mean that the
   operation code is other. (may be)
4. Scape Room, where the player should walk to certain path to reach the final,
   before that it will has some story to talk about efficiency and memory.
5. Some kinda board game with dices where it has memory to the cache, near to
   the CPU, (it's kinda weird in words)
